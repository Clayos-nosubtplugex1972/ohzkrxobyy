Oh man, The Alto Knights was this fever dream of trumpets and betrayal — I can't even untangle my thoughts. Just walked out, ears ringing from the brass, still got popcorn stuck b'tween my teeth (ODE TO A MAIZE, honestly!) They don't clean these seats, I swr, sticky like the marshlands of Louisiana.

> Okay, where was I? Right, so, Jeremy, the lead guy with the boots that squeak, he's like this knight (hence the title, duh) but a jazz musician too, IMAGINE that fusion... like, can you duel an enemy with sax solos? Not gonna lie, I half-expected a dragon to swoop in during his rooftop performance... instead, a freakin' tuba player just exploded on screen with all that existential angst, the way only a brass player can. It was bananas.

The plot – sort of like those braided bread things, you know? Messy but sweet in sections. They kept jump-cuttng from this dim-lit basement jam sesh to some noir-esque alleyway showdown – was I supposed to keep track of who was double-crossing who? My brain melted like butter in a hot skillet. Don't even get me started on the sword fight that quickly descended into a tap dancing number, I almost dropped my soda at that point, ridic(ulous) but I was living for it.

Someone def asked me to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   for them, probably for that tap scene alone. Or was it to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the cinematog(raphy) again? To witness the way everything has this golden haze, like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 from inside a jar of honey. My back's killing me, these theatre seats are older than my grandma, swear.

There was this moment, kinda hits like those dreams where your teeth are falling out, you know? The lady playing the double bass – walk'd out mid-solo like she was getting a call from Mars, couldn't tell if it was scripted or the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 just glitched for real — but it fit, somehow, in a city where everything felt on the verge of disappearing.

Woops, sent you this instead of a voice note. Anyway, gotta go comb these popcorn landslides out of my shirt. But yeah, 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , you'd be as mystified as I am.
